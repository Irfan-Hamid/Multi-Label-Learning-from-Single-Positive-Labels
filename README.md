# Species Distribution Modeling 
The primary objective of the project is to tackle the limitations posed by
datasets that only provide information about the presence of a species without
explicit confirmation of absence. Employing machine learning models, we predict
the presence or absence of species in a given geographic location. Specifically,
we implemented a multi-species model, leveraging the capabilities of a neural
network and several different loss functions. 

## Requirements:
Run the following command to install the necessary modules from the requirements.txt file:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Data:
This project uses data with npz extension. Ensure that you have the necessary files in this directory before running the application. The data files have already been included in the folder 'data'.

## Latex 
The LaTeX source files for this project are stored in a compressed format for convenience. You can find them in the 11.zip file located in the repository (folder named 'report')

## Models:
After installing the dependencies and setting up the data, you can run the models, Baseline_(BCE)_model.ipynb, Model_with_UPLloss.ipynb and Model_with_WANloss.ipynb
